# VulnScanner

This is just a vulnerability scanner. It scans all the open ports and if it retrieves some banners from the open ports it will print it. It will take three inputs. The number
of ports you want to scan, targets ip or domain name and a file with the vulnerable banners. There is a sample vulbanners file if you can see the sample ip to test it is 
192.168.68.133 and the sample no. of ports to scan is 10000 or any number you like.
